Met with Megan in the AM to do a test run on the GC.
Started a test run of 5 samples, first was the first batch of 11AA standards, then all three salmon samples, then the second batch of 11AA standards.
Used the standards in position 8 and position 16 of the box.

Results of the test run yesterday do not look good.
Neither batch of standards produced any peaks. 
SAL_2 had some good peaks but nothing from SAL_3 and only 4 peaks on SAL_1

Starting to dissolve scales for one more test salmon sample, trying 10 full scales to see what will happen.
Weight is 0.0074g, ID: SAL_230207.

Putting individual amino acids into each of the vials to make new standards with a higher concentration.
Each vial will get 20ul of each of 11 amino acids, and 80 of Tyrosine. 

In total there are 5 standards of 12AA.
I am not starting the prep process on these today, I am only mixing them in the vials in order to save time since it is late in that day.

Evaporating the one test salmon sample to dryness, but do not have time to add the 1 mL of 0.01N HCl, I will do this tomorrow before the column purification.

Ran out of time last time I was working to evaporate the sample to dryness. Doing that today and I will add the 1 mL of 0.01N HCl.
I will stop for now after this since the next stage is a little time consuming.

Prepared column and did column purification on the one salmon sample, ID: SAL_230207

SAL_230207 spilled during the dripping down out of the column stage so that sample is done.

Starting over on two new salmon samples. One will be Chinook, one will be Sockeye because I'm running out of Sockeye test scales. 
Chinook scales are being pulled from the scale card and sonicated for 6 minutes.

Doing the first prep step on the 5 standards I started prepping the other day.
Adding the 4:1 made a clear separation in the vials. I shook them up but they separated again pretty quick. We'll see what they look like after heating. 
I think it's because there's so much water in the standard solutions. 

3 new salmon samples have been in HCl for 70 minutes and evaporated to dryness. I added the 1 mL of 0.01 N HCl and am letting them sit like this.

5 amino acid standards have heen hydrolyzed and evaporated.

I realized I did the wrong 4:1 solution in the 5 standards so they need to be thrown out...

Starting 3 new 11 amino acid standard mixes. Each vial got 20ul of each of 11 amino acids, and 80 of Tyrosine.

Took overnight to dry salmon samples after the column purification because I turned off the heat because I had to go home. 
Added the 1 mL of 0.01 HCl this morning and letting the sample dissolve. 
The sample is very dry and solid at the bottom of the vial so it's a little challenging to fully dissolve but going ok so far. 
The Sockeye sample is dissolving the worst but both the Chinook ones are looking pretty good. Will wait the full 30 minutes before starting the defatting process so I'm hoping the sample will be fully dissolved by then.

Adding 2 mL of the 3:2 hexanes:DCM to all of the samples and creating an emulsion, following by centrifuge to de-fat.

The salmon salmons were drying under N2 overnight. Removed them today and they are fully dry.

Started on the esterification with the three standards and the three scale test samples.
Added the 4:1 IPA mixture and waited the 120 minutes, then evaporated. 
The scales evaporated quickly, the standards are taking quite a bit longer. 

## 2023-02-19
Started the derivitization by acylation. 
The standards are looking great and everything is doing what it should, but the scales were pretty crusty after evaporating yesterday.
These will evaporate at room temp under N2 today and I am gonna leave them because I don't have that much time to wait. 
They are not on heat so burning is not a control. 

Mixed 5 new standard solutions that I will prep later when I know if these current standards are successful. 

## 2023-02-22
Doing liquid-liquid extraction on the 6 samples. 
All the samples had some residue on the bottom but after adding chemicals and shaking this went away completley. 
So far everything suggests that these samples are going to look good. 

Spilled a tiny bit of C2 when transfering with a pipette into the glass tube. 
Still gonna run it but something to keep in mind if the results are weird.
