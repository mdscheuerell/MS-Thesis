Met with Megan in the AM to do a test run on the GC.
Started a test run of 5 samples, first was the first batch of 11AA standards, then all three salmon samples, then the second batch of 11AA standards.
Used the standards in position 8 and position 16 of the box.

Results of the test run yesterday do not look good.
Neither batch of standards produced any peaks. 
SAL_2 had some good peaks but nothing from SAL_3 and only 4 peaks on SAL_1

Starting to dissolve scales for one more test salmon sample, trying 10 full scales to see what will happen.
Weight is 0.0074g.
