Starting to organize scales and going to start on the 2022 wood samples as sort of a test since we have a lot of extra scales.
I'm organizing scales into vials to keep track of everything.

Wood (green), Egegik (red), Kvichak (blue)

Year, category (CSIA-half, bulk-half, punched), ocean age (two or three)

Sonicating for 10 minutes to remove the residue from the scale card.

After cutting and punching, I will weigh each sample.
