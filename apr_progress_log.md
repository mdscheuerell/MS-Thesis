Brought down the samples that I had already prepared and that we ran already. After the last run (I think on the 7th but forgot to write it down), we had reason to believe the column needed to be trimmed since the standards still did not look good. 
Gordon and I trimmed the column and brought the oven back to the temp that it started at a couple days before running again. 
After bringing down the samples under N2, I brought them back up in 100 uL ethyl acetate.
I will run them again.

The samples look the exact same as before trimming the column so we are not sure about next steps.
We are noticing that we get about 5 peaks on the standards (there should be 12) on the lower concentrations (40 uL and 60 uL), but the peaks shrink at higher concentrations. 
Next step is to raise the 80 and 60 in 200 uL of ethyl acetate and see if this changes anything. 
We might also try replacing all the amino acid powders that we have.
