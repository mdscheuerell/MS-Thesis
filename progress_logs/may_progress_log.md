Did another GC standard test run of the individual amino acids. I had 6 samples, one each of norleucine, glutamic acid and phenylalaine, and each had either 20 uL or 40 uL.
We got really good looking peaks for both norleucine and phenylalanine but nothing for glutamic acid.

We will try reordering some of the powders and seeing if that helps things to look better.

Got the new standard powders yesterday. We ordered new alanine, glutamic acid, valine, and phenylalanine. 

Megan said the the 5 standard peaks that have been consistenly showing up in the data are the leucine groups, plus phenylalanine and valine. 
I will keep using these 5, but I will remix phenylalanine with the new powders.

Starting my next set of test standards with the solutions mixed from the new powders.

I am doing a total of 8 standards, each has only one amino acid. 

Isoleucine has 20 uL

Valine has 20 uL 

Alanine has 20 uL

Norleucine has 20 uL

Glutamic acid has both a 20 uL and a 40 uL

Phenylalanine has both a 20 uL and a 40 uL

Starting isopropanol esterfication, this evaporation happens on heat so I cannot leave it overnight. 
Glu-40 got a little messed up because the vial was damaged so a lot of liquid seems to have leaked out.
Since Glu-20 looks good I think it should be fine.
