Did another GC standard test run of the individual amino acids. I had 6 samples, one each of norleucine, glutamic acid and phenylalaine, and each had either 20 uL or 40 uL.
We got really good looking peaks for both norleucine and phenylalanine but nothing for glutamic acid.

We will try reordering some of the powders and seeing if that helps things to look better.

Got the new standard powders yesterday. We ordered new alanine, glutamic acid, valine, and phenylalanine. 

Megan said the the 5 standard peaks that have been consistenly showing up in the data are the leucine groups, plus phenylalanine and valine. 
I will keep using these 5, but I will remix phenylalanine with the new powders.
