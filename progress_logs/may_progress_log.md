Got the new standard powders yesterday. We ordered new alanine, glutamic acid, valine, and phenylalanine. 

Megan said the the 5 standard peaks that have been consistenly showing up in the data are the leucine groups, plus phenylalanine and valine. 
I will keep using these 5, but I will remix phenylalanine with the new powders.
