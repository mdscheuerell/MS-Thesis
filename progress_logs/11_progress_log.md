Doing esterfication of the batch of 7 samples that I had ready first.
Blowing down.

Doing derivitization of the 7 that I esterified yesterday.
Blowing these down.
This is the batch that contains:

74-K-2, 71-E-2, 71-E-3, 71-K-2, 71-K-3, 68-W-2, 68-W-3.

I am slightly concerned I mixed these up but if the peaks on all 14 look good then I know I was fine. 

Doing liquid-liquid extraction of these samples and then finishing them and getting them in GC vials. 
When redissolving in hexanes/DCM, there were some chunks in the sample that wouldn't dissolve which isn't super typical. 

Doing esterfication of the other 7.
Blowing these down. 

Acid hydrolysis on four new duplicate samples, these are: 

01-E-3-R, 89-W-2-R, 89-K-2-R, 74-W-2-R.

Blowing these down under N2

Derivitizing the 7 samples, these are: 

84-W-3, 65-K-2, 67-E-3, 65-W-2, 65-E-2, 68-K-2, 67-E-2

Blowing these down and leaving at this step for today. 

Column purification and filtration on the 4 replicates. Blowing these down and leaving this here.

Doing liquid-liquid extraction and finishing up the 7 samples that I derivitized on friday. 

De-fatting the 4 replicates and leaving them to blow down over night. 

## 2023-11-07
Esterfying the 4 replicates. Blowing them down under N2 and on heat. 

## 2023-11-08
Derivitizing the 4 replicates. Blowing them down under N2 with no heat. 

Mixed a new acid bath. 

## 2023-11-16
I am going to finish up 3 of the 4 replicates. I only have enough inserts for 3 so that's why I'm not doing all of them.
