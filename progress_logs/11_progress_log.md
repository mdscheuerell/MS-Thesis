Doing esterfication of the batch of 7 samples that I had ready first.
Blowing down.

Doing derivitization of the 7 that I esterified yesterday.
Blowing these down.
This is the batch that contains:
74-K-2, 71-E-2, 71-E-3, 71-K-2, 71-K-3, 68-W-2, 68-W-3.
I am slightly concerned I mixed these up but if the peaks on all 14 look good then I know I was fine. 

Doing liquid-liquid extraction of these samples and then finishing them and getting them in GC vials. 
When redissolving in hexanes/DCM, there were some chunks in the sample that wouldn't dissolve which isn't super typical. 


Doing esterfication of the other 7.
Blowing these down.
