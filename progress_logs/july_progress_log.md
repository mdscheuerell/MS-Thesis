Getting back into the lab today.
While I was gone, Gordon got started on prepping a bunch of standards and individual amino acids. 
What we have:

5 standard mixes (3 reps)

4 single AAs (PHE had a problem so was tossed out)

Val

Ala

Glu

Nle

Blowing down the tubes and adding DCM, blowing down DCM and adding 100 uL of ethyl acetate. 
Running some of these samples today and then the other half tomorrow. 
Column on the GC has been oxidized.

Making two test salmon scales before I start bulk processing the real samples. 
The two test samples are 6.570 mg and 4.785 mg. Both are full scales with no hole punching and no dividing. 

Test ran the last 3 samples on the GC.

Doing the acid hydrolysis, filtration and column purification of the two test samples. 
Everything has looked good so far with no concerns with either of these test samples.
The NH4OH is blowing down slowly so I will be turning off the heat and leaving it under N2 overnight. 

All the GC standards and invdividual AAs are looking good and so I think those are ready to go as soon as I have samples ready.

The samples didn't quite blow down overnight so I turned the heating block back on and they finished in 1-2 hours.
They were super crusty looking but after I added the 1 mL of 0.01 N HCl that went away almost immediatley and now I think they look good.
