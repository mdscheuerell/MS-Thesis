I started esterfication on the 8 samples that I dried overnight under N2.
I will be blowing these down under N2 at 55 C today and then capping them.
These will be left in a vial rack under the fume hood. 

Defatting the 9 samples that I did column purification and filtration on yesterday.
Will be leaving these blowing down in the hood overnight.

Learned today that all my samples in my run on friday were too small. 
This leads me to believe that I should really be raising all my samples in 50 uL ethyl acetate to start with and I can go up if necessary. 

I left out the samples that I was blowing down since Friday so hopefully this didn't mess anything up. 
These are sample 98-E-2 through 92-W-3.

Derivitizing the samples that I esterfied on Friday and blowing these down under N2 with no heat. This includes the replicates.

Doing liquid-liquid extraction and finishing up the set of 8 samples that contains the replicates. 

Also doing esterfication on the 9 samples that are blown down. 
Blowing these down under N2 and on heat and then capping.

Doing derivitization of the 9 samples.
Blowing down with no heat.
Will be finishing these today so that it is done before I leave for a week and nothing is sitting half done. 
Raising these almost all in 50 again.

Starting acid hydrolysis on 8 new samples.
Doing samples 93-k-2 through 86-W-2.
Adding 20 uL norleucine.
Blowing down with heat under N2.

I blew down and reraised a batch of samples that were raised in 100 uL ethyl acetate and brought them up in 50 uL.

Added 1 mL 0.01 HCl to the samples from yesterday and let sit for 30 minutes. 
Doing column purification and filtration on these today.
