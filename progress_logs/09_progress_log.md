I started esterfication on the 8 samples that I dried overnight under N2.
I will be blowing these down under N2 at 55 C today and then capping them.
These will be left in a vial rack under the fume hood. 

Defatting the 9 samples that I did column purification and filtration on yesterday.
Will be leaving these blowing down in the hood overnight.
