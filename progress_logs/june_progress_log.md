Doing liquid-liquid extraction today. 

After adding the P buffer water I let the samples sit for a little bit (~45 minutes) because I had to go to lab meeting. 
Some of them turned blue which has defintiely never happened before so I wonder if there was some weird problematic reaction that happened. 
The blue samples are: ALA-20, PHE-20, and ISO-20.

The blue part was in the organic fraction on top that we pipette off, so the final samples will likely also be blue...
