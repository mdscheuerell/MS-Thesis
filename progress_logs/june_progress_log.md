Doing liquid-liquid extraction today. 

After adding the P buffer water I let the samples sit for a little bit (~45 minutes) because I had to go to lab meeting. 
Some of them turned blue which has defintiely never happened before so I wonder if there was some weird problematic reaction that happened. 
The blue samples are: ALA-20, PHE-20, and ISO-20.

The blue part was in the organic fraction on top that we pipette off, so the final samples will likely also be blue...

Running today, only doing 6 of the 8 samples that I prepped because of GC space.
I am running both Glu, both Phe, Nor and Val.
I realized just now that I forgot to run the oxidation sequence but since this is just to see if we get any peak I'm gonna ignore it.
Also just realized that the IsoLink settings are wrong since I restarted the computer, so I'm canceling but I'll let it finish this first sample first. 

Changed my mind about oxidation. Since I need to stop the run after one sample anyway, I think I will do an oxidation sequence and come back later today.

I will remove Val from this run because I think I might run out of liquid N with how long this prep stage will take.
