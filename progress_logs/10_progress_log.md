De-fatting of the 8 samples today and then will leave them to blow down overnight. 

Starting acid hydrolysis on 8 new samples today.
These new samples are 77-K-2 through 71-W-3.
These samples are the ones in the vial rack in the fume hood.

Doing esterfication of the 8 samples that were left to blow down overnight.
I am leaving these samples in the vial rack. 

Doing column purification and filtration on the 8 samples that are in the rack that were de-fatted yesterday. 
74-K-2 tipped over and will need to be redone.
Leaving these in the fume hood NOT in the vial rack.

Doing derivitization of the 8 samples I esterfied yesterday. Blowing these down.

Doing liquid-liquid extraction of the 8 samples and will be finishing these off. 

Will do esterfication of the now 7 samples that I column purified on the 3rd. 
71-W-2 did something a little weird where there was a lot of suction of the samples and the cap.
Possible some sample was lost during the esterfication?

Will also be blowing these down today.
