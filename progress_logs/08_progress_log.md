Did isopropanol esterfication of the two test samples today.
The smallers test sample did kind of a weird thing because I think the vial is damaged so all the liquid was gone after about an hour.
The larger one also leaked when I removed the cap.
They are also both super crusty looking so I wonder if these aren't that great, but I'm gonna keep going and try test running anyway. 
Finished derivitization by acylation and evaporated. 

I am also still working on the 6 real samples that I started the other day. 
I did the filtration and column purification and have them blowing down under N2 on heat. 
They are seeming pretty good so far except for that one sample in the damaged vial that looked burned.
Again, will keep going and see what happens. 
Finished de-fatting and I will stop after this step for today. 

## 2023-08-02
Finished the two test samples and running today. 
They are raised in 100 uL ethyl acetate.
If peaks are too small I will try raising in 50 uL ethyl acetate.

Doing isopropanol esterfication on the six samples and will blow down and leave at that stage until the next time that I can make it into the lab. 

## 2023-08-04
Doing the derivitization by acylation today of the six samples. 
Gordon told me today that the icing of the samples is super important because the gas escapes from the samples and then we don't get peaks. 
I'm a little worried that will happen with these but nothing ever exploded like last time. 
Some of the samples might be a little bit burned but I will reevaluate how everything is looking after redissolving. 
The very small samples I am raising in 50 uL of ethyl acetate instead of 100 uL.
The volume of ethyl acetate used is recorded on the main sample csv. 

Remixed more 3-2 hexanes-DCM. 

Did liquid-liquid extraction on the 6 samples and moved them into GC vials. 

## 2023-08-07
The run on Friday looked good so I'm proceeding with prepping more samples and these ones I will save to run until we have the columns on the GC changed. 
Prepping 8 samples. 
Doing acid hydrolysis and column purification/filtration on these first 8.
Don't have time to de-fat, but I am leaving these eight in the white vial rack in the hood. 

Starting a second set of 8 and today I will do acid hydrolysis and pause after evaporation and finish tomorrow. 
I am removing these from heat after evaporation and leaving them in the hood. 
These are the samples NOT in the rack.

## 2023-08-08
I de-fatted the first group of eight samples from yesterday and am blowing them down overnight.
These samples are under the long N2 blow down set up. 
During the shaking one of the samples dropped and broke so I will be using the other half of the scales to redo this one.
This was sample ID 16-E-2. 

The second group of eight samples I did column purification/filtration and am blowing them down.
I am not de-fatting these today because only one group of eight can blow down overnight so it will be better to store them at this stage and finish tomorrow. 
The samples ready for de-fatting are in the white vial rack under the fume hood. 

## 2023-08-09
The first set of now seven samples look good after blowing down overnight. 
I did esterfication and blow down of these today and they are in the fume hood NOT in a rack.  

The second set of eight I will de-fat and leave to blow down overnight. 

I am also packing phenylalanine for BULK analysis on the EA so that I can figure out the true delta value because the numbers in the 5AA standard were a little strange. 

## 2023-08-10
After blowing down overnight not every sample (10-K-2 is not)is fully evaporated but most of them are. I am sticking these in the freezer for now.
Will do the next steps on these on another day. 

## 2023-08-11
Today I finished up the first set of 7 samples. 
The volume of ethyl acetate that I used in each is on the main sample spreadsheet. 
I am putting them in a row of box 2.

I am doing acid hydrolysis on another set of samples and will blow these down and filter today.
After column purification, these samples will be left in the fume hood NOT in the rack. 

The second set of 8 I will esterfy and blow down today. 
These will be left in the vial rack in the fume hood. 
After esterification. These were given 15 minutes in the freezer to cool down before being opened and put under N2.

## 2023-08-14
I will derivitize the 8 samples that I finished esterfication with on Friday. 
After derivitization these all look kind of burnt. 
These are samples 13-W-2 through 10-K-2.
Doing liquid-liquid on these so these are all finished as of today. 

Did defatting on the other samples and leaving them overnight under N2 to blow down. 

Starting acid hydrolysis with a new set of samples, will try doing 9 this time. These samples are updated on the main csv and labeled "acid hydrolysis".
Blowing these down and then capping. 

## 2023-08-15
The samples that were blown down overnight are looking really good.
I will be doing esterfication of these today and blowing them down after, then they will be left under the fume hood, NOT in the rack. 

The 9 samples I am doing column purification and filtration today and then blowing them down. 
I am leaving these samples in the rack. 

## 2023-08-17
Did defatting of the 9 samples and have them under N2 where I will leave them overnight. 

I moved the 8 samples that are ready for derivitization into the rack in the hood. 
Did not end up dericitizing today. 

## 2023-08-18
Changed the reaction column on the GC and started the long pre-oxidation cycle. 

Took the 9 samples out from under N2 and capped them. 

## 2023-08-21
Starting an oxidation cycle to test run the new GC column tomorrow. 

Doing derivitization of the 8 samples in the rack.

## 2023-08-22
I'm gonna rerun the 6 samples that I already ran with some different concentrations.
22-W-3 should be raised in 50 uL.
22-K-3 should be raised in 50 uL. 
I will not be doing this today. This just serves as a note for when I do. 

Esterfying the 9 samples today and blowing them down under N2 with heat then capping and storing overnight. 

Doing liquid-liquid and finalizing the 8 samples today.

Blowing down the 1st 5AA standard and raising in 200 uL ethyl acetate instead of 100 uL.

## 2023-08-24
Doing derivitization on the 9 samples. 
Blowing them down under N2 with no heat.
I will be leaving these samples in the fume hood in the vial rack and doing liquid-liquid extraction tomorrow. 

Checking out the test run of the one 200 uL standard that I started on Tuesday with the new column. 
Looks good so I am starting another run of 5 more samples and a 200 uL standard following Megan's sequence format. 
I am doing an oxidation cycle prior to this run by checking that box on the sequence sheet. 

Starting acid hydrolysis on 8 samples, including three replicates.
The replicates that I will be running are noted in the main csv file. 
I will blow these down today and then cap and leave them in the fume hood not in a rack.
