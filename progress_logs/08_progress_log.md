Did isopropanol esterfication of the two test samples today.
The smallers test sample did kind of a weird thing because I think the vial is damaged so all the liquid was gone after about an hour.
The larger one also leaked when I removed the cap.
They are also both super crusty looking so I wonder if these aren't that great, but I'm gonna keep going and try test running anyway. 
Finished derivitization by acylation and evaporated. 

I am also still working on the 6 real samples that I started the other day. 
I did the filtration and column purification and have them blowing down under N2 on heat. 
They are seeming pretty good so far except for that one sample in the damaged vial that looked burned.
Again, will keep going and see what happens. 
Finished de-fatting and I will stop after this step for today.

Finished the two test samples and running today. 
They are raised in 100 uL ethyl acetate.
If peaks are too small I will try raising in 50 uL ethyl acetate.

Doing isopropanol esterfication on the six samples and will blow down and leave at that stage until the next time that I can make it into the lab.

Doing the derivitization by acylation today of the six samples. 
Gordon told me today that the icing of the samples is super important because the gas escapes from the samples and then we don't get peaks. 
I'm a little worried that will happen with these but nothing ever exploded like last time.
