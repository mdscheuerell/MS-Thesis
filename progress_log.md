Picked up working on the second set of 8 12AA standards. Did not remember where I left off last time I stopped working on them. 
I am pretty sure I finished derivitization by acetylation last time so I started liquid-liquid but I am not certain. 

Started the isopropanol esterfication step on the 3 freeze drier test scale samples that I prepared over winter break.
The freeze drying step led to a little bit of the sample leaking out the side so I don't know if these will be high quality but will test run.
Sample 3 has lots of large chunks, sample 1 has some, and sample 2 has none. Maybe this is an indication that smaller samples are better quality.
These samples have been heated for 120 minutes and evaporated.
Evaporated samples were returned to the fridge.
