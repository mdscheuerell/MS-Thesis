Picked up working on the second set of 8 12AA standards. Did not remember where I left off last time I stopped working on them. 
I am pretty sure I finished derivitization by acetylation last time so I started liquid-liquid but I am not certain. 

Started the isopropanol esterfication step on the 3 freeze drier test scale samples that I prepared over winter break.
The freeze drying step led to a little bit of the sample leaking out the side so I don't know if these will be high quality but will test run.
Sample 3 has lots of large chunks, sample 1 has some, and sample 2 has none. Maybe this is an indication that smaller samples are better quality.
These evaporated way faster than the standards usually do. 
After evaporation all the samples had a lot of chunks on the inside of the vial that I'm not sure will end up dissolving. 
Not sure how this would be prevented.
These samples have been heated for 120 minutes and evaporated at temp.
Evaporated samples were returned to the fridge.

Started the derivitization by acylation step on the 3 test scale samples.
Heated to 110 degrees C for 120 minutes at appriximately 12:45pm. 
Evaporated the samples at room temp under N2, started at 1:50ish, all evaporations finished by 3:30. All evaporated at a similar speed.
Put back in the fridge to end the day.

Realized I skipped repeating on step 9 of liquid-liquid with the standards from the 11th so further reason these might not be high quality and there is much less in the vial.

Liquid-liquid extraction for the three scale samples. 
The hexanes:DCM mixture did a good job redissolving the samples so the chunks and crust that was there after the last step is gone.
When transfering from the disposable tubes to the GC vial there seemed to be some very small particulates around the edge of the tube that did not transfer fully to the GC vial.
Tubes were filled twice with DCM and transfered to the GC vial. 

After centrifuging the top fraction was clear with nothing in it. 
The bottom section looked orangey in color and had some chunks.
