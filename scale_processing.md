Starting to organize scales and going to start on the 2022 wood samples as sort of a test since we have a lot of extra scales.
I'm organizing scales into vials to keep track of everything.

Wood (green), Egegik (red), Kvichak (yellow)

Year, category (CSIA-half, bulk-half, punched), ocean age (two or three)

Sonicating for 10 minutes to remove the residue from the scale card.

After cutting and punching, I will weigh each sample.

Pulled and sonicated scales from 2004 and organized into vials. Will take a scale count when I weight because every now and then scales are lost while pulling or moving into vials.

Started punching the scales because they are almost all pulled now. 
Punched: 
2022_wood_2 (missed a couple sticky ones)
