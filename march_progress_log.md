Got back the results from the test run yesterday and the chinook salmon samples look good, which indicates aiming for around 7-8 scales is the right mass.
No idea why the standards still have no signal at all.

Take a lot of one amino acid and run it to see if I get any signal 200 uL and one that's 2 mL. 30 sclaes is optimal, cut those in half, write down the number, scale the concnetraiton of ethyl acetate at the end to get the right peak size. 14 is the lowest we can go, anything below that number of scales cannot be used. Skip the year if there is no age data available.

Gordon thinks the standard issue is from having too small of a mass of nitrogen in 20 uL of each amino acid. 
I am preparing standards of only one amino acid with a much higher amount to see if we can get a signal.
I will prepare Ala_0.2 which is 200 uL of alanine, Ala_2, which is 2 mL of alanine and do the same volumes with norleucine as well.
The individual amino acids are all mixed to 0.05 M. 

I pulled a bunch of sockeye scales that I will use for more testing of the proper mass. 

On the new standards I am doing the isopropanol esterfication stage today. I expect some of these will take a very long time to evaporate under N2 so I might turn off the heat and let them go overnight.

I left the 2 mL standards overnight under N2 to dry with no heat because it was taking forever. Today in the morning they were not fully evaporated and looked kind of gooey. I think this is just because there is so much amino acid in them so I closed the lids and will continue from here.

Mixed new 4:1 IPA: acetyl chloride. 

Doing derivatization of the 4 standards. Chem doesn't mix great with sample because there was still so much goo leftover. 
Samples will be left to dry over night to make sure that they are fully dry.

The 2 mL standards have large crystalized looking chunks and the buffer water mostly dissolved this but not everything.
The 0.2 mL samples look pretty good. 
Doing liquid-liquid extraction today and getting samples into the GC vials. 

Raising standards in 100 uL ethyl acetate. 

## 2023-03-13
Starting the 3 15 scale test samples. Added 40 uL of norleucine since it seems like 20 uL isn't enough. 

## 2023-03-14 
Filtered the 3 test samples through the column. Everything is going as it should. I prepared the columns yesterday.

## 2023-03-15
De-fatted the 3 test samples. Blowing down the samples completely overnight under N2 at room temperature. 

## 2023-03-27
Added newly mixed standards to vials after shaking the solutions pretty thoroughly and letting them sit for a second for the bubbles to go away.
Standard mixes have all 12 amino acids at 40 uL, 60 uL, 80 uL or 100 uL of each. 
Tyrosine has 4 times the above listed volumes (160 uL, etc.).

Adding 4:1 IPA:acetyle chloride to the 4 standard mixes and the three scale samples and heating 120 minutes. 

Blowing down overnight to dry before starting on the next step.

I realized that I left the heat on overnight as well so it's possible the samples are all burned. Visually they look normal.
To be safe I am remaking the 4 standards following the same steps as yesterday but I will try to carry on with the same scale samples. 

Letting the scale samples sit and redoing the esterfication step with the four new standards.
