Got back the results from the test run yesterday and the chinook salmon samples look good, which indicates aiming for around 7-8 scales is the right mass.
No idea why the standards still have no signal at all.

Take a lot of one amino acid and run it to see if I get any signal 200 uL and one that's 2 mL. 30 sclaes is optimal, cut those in half, write down the number, scale the concnetraiton of ethyl acetate at the end to get the right peak size. 14 is the lowest we can go, anything below that number of scales cannot be used. Skip the year if there is no age data available.

Gordon thinks the standard issue is from having too small of a mass of nitrogen in 20 uL of each amino acid. 
I am preparing standards of only one amino acid with a much higher amount to see if we can get a signal.
I will prepare Ala_0.2 which is 200 uL of alanine, Ala_2, which is 2 mL of alanine and do the same volumes with norleucine as well.
The individual amino acids are all mixed to 0.05 M. 

I pulled a bunch of sockeye scales that I will use for more testing of the proper mass. 

On the new standards I am doing the isopropanol esterfication stage today. They will all take a different amount of time to dry.
