Got back the results from the test run yesterday and the chinook salmon samples look good, which indicates aiming for around 7-8 scales is the right mass.
No idea why the standards still have no signal at all.

Take a lot of one amino acid and run it to see if I get any signal 200 uL and one that's 2 mL. 30 sclaes is optimal, cut those in half, write down the number, scale the concnetraiton of ethyl acetate at the end to get the right peak size. 14 is the lowest we can go, anything below that number of scales cannot be used. Skip the year if there is no age data available.
